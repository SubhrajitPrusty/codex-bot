Be respectful. Dont spam. Read the group rules.

In the @codexinit group 

* check someone's submission - ask them if they can make improvements 

* ask them what they're familiar with or working on

* give them a suitable minor - but something that they have to learn in a short time period
or if they seem weak with structuring code, then something that requires a good structure (a game would be one example)

You don't have to be an admin to review submissions.
